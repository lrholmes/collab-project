				<p>Listen to my detective notes here:</p>
				<audio controls><source src='../audio/episode2.ogg' type='audio/ogg'></audio>
				<p>I have outdone myself once more. Solving yet another unsolvable case with my inconceivable wits and talent. In fact I will be completely unsurprised if I read about this very case tomorrow in the papers. Front page obviously.</p>

				<p>The whole thing started when I received a phone call early that morning, where I was informed by the police that there had been a murder. A horrible and tragic murder that they needed my help with. So of course once Grieves had come to pick me up I headed straight there. After all, you can’t waste time when there’s a murderer on the loose.</p>

				<p>After examining the body I noticed two distinct things, the first being that the victim most definitely did not drown, and the second that the deceased had a terrible sense of fashion. It was the latter which was most important, as after a very long tirade of deduction and deducing I decided that this was in fact the cause of death. That because of the victims poor taste in clothing her parents or even her partner (if she surprisingly had one) had chose to put her out of her misery. Thinking that it probably for the best, I mean she couldn’t even match her shoes, she wouldn’t have lasted long. </p>

				<p>Other notable things which happened today, excluding my grand display of intellect, was a rather aggressive swan, who attempted to bite my privates. (Unsuccessfully I should add). As well as the discovery of the most pointless train ever to exist. Which took me on an entire tour of the park before stopping at the same place I got on. It was absolutely useless. Lastly there was the oddity of Grieves’ behaviour, changing back and forth between clothing for seemingly no reason. </p>

				<p>This may in fact be something that needs investigating. </p>
